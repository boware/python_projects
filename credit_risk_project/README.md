# Credit Risk Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting credit risk using machine learning. The goal is to predict whether an applicant will default on a loan based on personal and financial information. The dataset used is from the **Home Credit Default Risk** dataset available on Kaggle.

## Project Structure:

- **/data**: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- **/scripts**: Contains Python scripts for data downloading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **/notebooks**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies.
- **credit_risk_model.pkl**: The trained model for predicting credit risk.

## How to Run:

### 1. Install Dependencies
To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
